					<h3>~ A bit about me ~</h3>

					<p>{`I'll be a developer for the rest of my life because it's not only a career, it's a passion. The joy of solving a tricky bugfix or code challenge is downright addictive. And nothing gets me in the zone like working on some project I'm into. That's when I lose track of time and the world falls away and all there is is the code.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`But I didn't start in web development. Worked in construction first. I loved fixing things and building things and I was good at it. But after a few years, I realized I couldn't see myself doing it forever.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`Bartending was next. I loved handling the rush and putting smiles on people's faces and I was good at it. But again, I wasn't sure if I wanted to do it forever.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`Necessity required that I become a stay-at-home father next. I loved those years spent with my kids and being there for my special needs son and I hope I was good at it. But I knew I couldn't do it forever.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`So I started playing around with web development in 2014. Fell in love with it right away. Studied for a couple years and landed myself a small contract role as a mentor at an online coding bootcamp.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`And that's when I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I found a whole new way to build things and fix things and put smiles on people's faces: web development. I finally knew what I wanted to be when I grew up: a developer.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`So I continued studying and worked my way up to running a couple bootcamps. And in 2021, I worked a short contract role as a Front-end React Developer.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`That contract ended earlier this year and now I'm looking for the next chapter in my journey.`}</p>
					<br />

					<p>{`What Iâ€™m looking for:`}</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Junior to mid-level front end developer role.</li>
						<li>Remote only.</li>
						<li>Pacific time zone.</li>
						<li>Full or part time okay.</li>
						<li>{`Prefer long term W2, but contract is okay. (Authorized to work in the US if that matters.)`}</li>
					</ul>

					<p>{`Professional Experience:`}</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Nearly 6 years programming, styling and debugging websites and apps with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and general front end technologies.</li>
						<li>Approximately 3 years building with React - functional components and hooks.</li>
						<li>Approximately 1 year building sites, APIs and databases on the back end with Node, Express, SQLite and REST.</li>
						<li>Approximately .5 years developing in a production environment.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>{`And when I'm not working or writing code, I love to learn new things and spend time with my family. I love to watch movies and play the guitar and play video games with my kids. I love the outdoors, but don't get out there as much as I should. I love to read and build things. And whenever possible, I love to ponder the meaning of life, the nature of reality, the essence of truth, the mystery of consciousness, and the clockworks of the human condition.`}</p>
